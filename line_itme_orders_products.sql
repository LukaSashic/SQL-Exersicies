-- JOINS

-- Query 1. Our first query should return the "sku", "product_quantity", "date" and "unit_price" from the line_item table together with the "name" and the "price" of each product from the "products" table. We want only products present in both tables.

SELECT p.name_en, l.product_quantity AS quantity, l.date, l.unit_price,  p.price, l.sku
FROM line_item l
INNER JOIN products p
ON l.sku = p.sku
LIMIT 100

-- Query 2. You might notice that the unit_price from the line_item table and the price from the product table is not the same. Let's investigate that! Extend your previous query by adding a column with the difference in price. Name that column price_difference.

SELECT p.name_en, l.product_quantity AS quantity, l.date, l.unit_price,  p.price, p.price - l.unit_price AS price_difference, l.sku
FROM line_item l
INNER JOIN products p
ON l.sku = p.sku
LIMIT 100

-- Query 3. Build a query that outputs the price difference that you just calculated, grouping products by category. Round the result.

SELECT  p.manual_categories, AVG(p.price - l.unit_price) AS price_difference
FROM line_item l
INNER JOIN products p
ON l.sku = p.sku
GROUP BY p.manual_categories


-- Query 4. Create the same query as before (calculating the price difference between the line_item and the products tables, but now grouping by brands instead of categories.

SELECT  p.brand, AVG(p.price - l.unit_price) AS price_difference
FROM line_item l
INNER JOIN products p
ON l.sku = p.sku
GROUP BY p.brand


-- Query 5. Let's focus on the brands with a big price difference: run the same query as before, but now limiting the results to only brands with an avg_price_dif of more than 50000. Order the results by avg_price_dif (bigger to smaller).

SELECT  p.brand, AVG(p.price - l.unit_price) AS avg_price_difference
FROM line_item l
INNER JOIN products p
ON l.sku = p.sku
GROUP BY p.brand
HAVING AVG(p.price - l.unit_price) > 50000
ORDER BY avg_price_difference DESC

-- Query 6. First, we will connect each product (sku) from the line_item table to the orders table. We only want sku that have been in any order. This table will contain duplicates, and we're ok with that. We will group and count this information later.

SELECT l.sku
FROM line_item l
JOIN orders o
ON l.id_order = o.id_order
LIMIT 100

-- Query 7. Now, add to the previous query the brand and the category from the products table to this query.

SELECT p.brand, p.manual_categories, l.sku
FROM line_item l
JOIN orders o
ON l.id_order = o.id_order
JOIN products p
ON l.sku=p.sku
LIMIT 100

-- Query 8. Let's keep working on the same query: now we want to keep only Cancelled orders. Modify this query to group the results from the previous query, first by category and then by brand, adding in both cases a count so we know which categories and which brands are most times present in Cancelled orders.

SELECT p.manual_categories, COUNT(o.id_order) AS Cnt, o.state
FROM line_item l
JOIN orders o
ON l.id_order = o.id_order
JOIN products p
ON l.sku=p.sku
GROUP BY p.manual_categories, o.state
HAVING o.state = "Cancelled" AND Cnt > 200
ORDER BY Cnt DESC

SELECT p.brand, COUNT(o.id_order) AS Cnt, o.state
FROM line_item l
JOIN orders o
ON l.id_order = o.id_order
JOIN products p
ON l.sku=p.sku
GROUP BY p.brand, o.state
HAVING o.state = "Cancelled" AND Cnt > 200
ORDER BY Cnt DESC
